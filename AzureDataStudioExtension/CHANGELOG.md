## [v8.0.0](https://github.com/MarkMpn/Sql4Cds/releases/tag/v8.0.0) - 2023-11-25

Added Common Table Expression support:

Query optimizer improvements:
- Prefer hash joins over merge joins if sorts cannot be folded

- Avoid folding filters to tables in subqueries if the same alias exists in the outer query
- Do not use a left outer join to implement `NOT IN` queries where the subquery uses an inner join

Fixed left outer join in nested loop when the first record has no matching records from the right source
Fixed use of partitioned aggregates within a loop
Avoid errors when using `DEBUG_BYPASS_OPTIMIZATION` hint
Avoid using custom paging for `IN` and `EXISTS` filters, and where a single child record is guaranteed by the filters
